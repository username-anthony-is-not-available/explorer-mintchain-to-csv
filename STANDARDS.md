| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Test Coverage** | ≥80% for new code                                              |
| **Linting**       | Must pass before merge                                         |

For complete details, see:
→ [Global STANDARDS.md](https://github.com/username-anthony-is-not-available/intelligent-project-manager/blob/main/.agent/workflows/templates/STANDARDS.md)

## Local Overrides

<!--
Add project-specific standards that EXTEND (not weaken) the global standards.
Example:
- Test coverage requirement: 90% (stricter than 80% global minimum)
- Additional required reviewers for smart contract changes
-->

None.
